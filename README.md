## What is it?

This app is a utility for master's of certain multiplayer role-playing games that involve lots of dice rolling.
I made this as I found the tempo of some encounters was slowed down to much by trying to remember all the bonuses and various dice for each type of monster.
This app (currently) has 13 of the most common monsters found in encounters with buttons for their various attacks.
When buttons are pressed, the attack and damage rolls are calculated along with natural 20s that double base damage, as well as information about saving thows related to poison.
While a lot of fun can be had with real physical dice, this app is an option for those that feel overwhelmed with the many specific details of each monster's attacks, or those who sometimes need to DM from a lawn chair drinking whisky.
